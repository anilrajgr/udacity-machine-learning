Project: Creating Customer Segments

Welcom to the third project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been
provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project.
Sections that being with 'Implementation' in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additonal functionality
which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implentation are marked in the code
block with 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read teh isntrctions carefull!

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions what you must answer which relate to teh proejct and your implementation.
Each section where you will answer a question is precded by a 'Question X' header. Carefully read each quedstion and provide
thorough answers in the following text boxes that being with 'Answer:'. Your proejct submission will be evalueated based on your answers
to each of the questions and the implemetatino you provide.

Getting Started

In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of
divers product categories for internal structure. One goal of this prjoect is to best describe the variation in the different types of
customers that a whoelsale distrubutor inteacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their
delivery service to meet the needs of each customer

The dataset for this proejct can be found on teh UCI Machine Learnign Repository. For the purposes of this project, teh features 'Channel'
and 'Region' will be excluded in the analysis - with focus instead on the six product categories recodrded for customers.
